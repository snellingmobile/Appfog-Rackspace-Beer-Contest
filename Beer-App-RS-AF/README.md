Appfog & Rackspace Apps and Beers contest!

Good luck in deploying your app! My app can be found [here](contestwinner.rs.af.cm).

Contest
--------------
Taken from the contest page located: [http://get.appfog.com/appsandbeers](http://get.appfog.com/appsandbeers)

```Here's the deal: Rackspace and AppFog are throwing a Happy Hour (please RSVP if you'd like to go, space is limited) at AppsWorld in San Francisco on Thursday, February 7. We need your help choosing the beers for the party. And weâ€™re willing to reward you for your help. 

All you have to do is register for the contest, and then create an app (deployed on AppFog and Rackspace) that allows folks to vote for which beers will be served at the happy hour. ```
